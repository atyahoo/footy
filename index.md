tactically adjust to the fact that other teams tend to generate counterattacks from tackling and winning the ball in the attacking third. Managers may place tactical emphasis on their team’s defensive shape while in possession, instructing defenders to make sure that opposition forwards are tightly marked to mitigate the threat of counterattacks. 
Set Pieces statistics 
Another key aspect of football is set pieces. Set pieces such as free kicks, corners and throw-ins occur frequently in matches. As a result, teams spend considerable time training set pieces, often creating set piece routines to maximise their chances of scoring. Utilising a bar chart we analyse the frequency of each type of set piece in both leagues.  
The bar indicates that freekicks and corner kicks occur slightly more often in the Premier League, however, there is a substantial disparity in the number of throw-ins as throw-ins occur significantly more frequently in the WSL. While it is difficult to say for certain why the WSL produces more throw-ins, tentative explanations can be provided. Perhaps, the frequent pressing and the lower passing accuracy in the WSL may explain why throw-ins occur so frequently. The frequent pressures may force players into rushed and misplaced passes that go out of play. Additionally, the lower passing accuracy indicates that misplaced passes are more prevalent and thus a significant portion of these misplaced passes may be going out of play. 
The regularity of throw-ins in the WSL would suggest that tactical emphasis on such set pieces would be highly beneficial. Premier League teams such as Brentford and Liverpool have directly benefited from the utilisation of a throw-in coach. For instance, Thomas Gronnemark has been influential in transforming Liverpool’s throw-ins
