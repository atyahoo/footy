tactically adjust to the fact that other teams tend to generate counterattacks from tackling and winning the ball in the attacking third. Managers may place tactical emphasis on their team’s defensive shape while in possession, instructing defenders to make sure that opposition forwards are tightly marked to mitigate the threat of counterattacks. 
Set Pieces statistics 
Another key aspect of football is set pieces. Set pieces such as free kicks, corners and throw-ins occur frequently in matches. As a result, teams spend considerable time training set pieces, often creating set piece routines to maximise their chances of scoring. Utilising a bar chart we analyse the frequency of each type of set piece in both leagues.  
The bar indicates that freekicks and corner kicks occur slightly more often in the Premier League, however, there is a substantial disparity in the number of throw-ins as throw-ins occur significantly more frequently in the WSL. While it is difficult to say for certain why the WSL produces more throw-ins, tentative explanations can be provided. Perhaps, the frequent pressing and the lower passing accuracy in the WSL may explain why throw-ins occur so frequently. The frequent pressures may force players into rushed and misplaced passes that go out of play. Additionally, the lower passing accuracy indicates that misplaced passes are more prevalent and thus a significant portion of these misplaced passes may be going out of play. 
The regularity of throw-ins in the WSL would suggest that tactical emphasis on such set pieces would be highly beneficial. Premier League teams such as Brentford and Liverpool have directly benefited from the utilisation of a throw-in coach. For instance, Thomas Gronnemark has been influential in transforming Liverpool’s throw-ins making them more efficient and dangerous Worville, T (2020). With the benefits being apparent, throw-in coaches should be utilised in the WSL as the benefits will only be amplified. 
Another thing to consider is that players that are long throw specialists are considerably more valuable in the WSL. Players with long throws are able to cover more distance and evade more opposition players with their throws. The nature of the WSL allows such players to demonstrate their skills and aid their team more frequently.
Shooting statistics
The bar chart displays the number of shots, number of shots on target and the distance of shots in both leagues. From the bar chart it is evident that the shooting statistics in the WSL mirror that of the Premier League. The average distance of shots taken is identical which suggests that teams in both leagues consider 16.8 yards to be the most optimal shooting distance. The number of shots on target is also the same in both leagues. This is partly due to teams shooting from the same distances on average whilst also taking a similar number of shots in a game.
 The bar chart below reveals that more shots stem from errors in the WSL. This could be due to the high pressing nature of the WSL as teams win the ball more frequently in the final third. Thus, players are often in shooting range when they do win the ball explaining why more shots stem from errors.
Earlier statistics revealed that WSL players complete more dribbles. Despite this, Premier League players complete more dribbles that lead to shots. This may be explained by the role of wingers. Within a team, wingers tend to dribble the most and would therefore contribute the most to these statistics. With this in mind, the statistics may be influenced by the influx of goal scoring wingers in the Premier League. Traditionally wingers would focus on crossing the ball to their strikers and would use dribbling and trickery to do so. However, in recent years inverted goal scoring wingers have become popular in the Premier League. Such wingers utilise their dribbling prowess to fashion shots on goal, Salah and Mane being prime examples of this trend. Thus, their prominence is likely to play a role in the disparity in the number of dribbles that led to shots. 

Goal statistics
Goals are the most important commodity in football as they are the margins that decide football games. Needless to say, every team aims to score as many goals as possible. A radar plot is produced displaying goal related statistics. The plot displays goals, expected goals (xG), non-penalty expected goals (npxG),  goals per shot (G/Sh), goals per shot on target (G/SoT). 
















Although the WSL and the Premier League differ in various aspects, the two leagues share remarkably similar characteristics when it comes to goal scoring statistics. From the radar plot it can be determined that both leagues share almost goals per shot, goals per shot on target and non-penalty expected goals. The WSL average slightly more goals per game than the Premier League despite the Premier league having a higher expected goals value. Thus, WSL teams outperformed their expected goals by a greater margin than their Premier League counterparts.
The bar chart displayed earlier on revealed differences in the frequency of different shot creating actions. For instance dribbling creates relatively more shots in the Premier League while relatively more shots stem from errors in the WSL. Considering this, it is interesting that the number of goals per shot is almost the same in both leagues. Thus, despite the differences in the shot creating actions, both leagues share the roughly same shooting efficiency.  
The WSL and the Premier League share almost the same non-penalty expected goals statistic while the Premier League has a slightly higher expected goals statistic. Thus, we can deduce that the expected goals statistic is only higher due to penalties being awarded more frequently in the Premier League.
 
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study has comprehensively examined the similarities and differences between the WSL and Premier League. From the results it is evident that the WSL and Premier League share some commonalities such as their goal scoring statistics.
However, ultimately there are a number of fundamental differences between the two leagues which changes the dynamics of their games. Some of the most notable differences are described below. The statistics reveal that the WSL produces significantly more tackles, interceptions, clearances and blocks relative to the Premier League. In addition, there is a significant disparity in the passing accuracies within the two leagues as WSL teams produce lower passing accuracies. Lastly, the statistics indicate that WLS teams engage in more pressures and are more successful when doing so. 
As there are a number of fundamental differences between the two leagues, it can be deduced that although the players in the WSL and Premier League play the same sport, the nature of their matches are different. Thus, the statistics reveal that WSL matches are of a more back-and-forth nature filled with frequent defensive actions. Additionally, the statistics indicate that WSL matches are more disjointed and played at a higher intensity. In light of this, managers and players in the WSL should adapt to these characteristics if they haven’t already.
Interestingly, it has been evident throughout this study that differences between the two leagues in one aspect of football may generate differences in other individual aspects of football. For instance, we deduce that the relatively low passing accuracy in the WSL plays a part in explaining why the WSL has comparatively high interception and throw-in statistics in the WSL. This indicates that there is an interdependency that is prevalent within different individual elements of football.
While this study has been thorough and comprehensive in its analysis, we acknowledge that it has several limitations. Firstly, the analysis was based only on the data from the 21/22 season. Thus, the use of more historical data is encouraged in future studies in order to increase the accuracy of results. In addition, the data in this study is limited to the performance metrics found on www.fbref.com. Consequently, we encourage future studies to expand on the performance metrics used in this study, allowing for fresh alternative perspectives.
Lastly, women’s football is an under-researched area within the literature of football. Thus, we hope this study provokes more research to be undertaken on one of the fastest growing sports in the UK.
